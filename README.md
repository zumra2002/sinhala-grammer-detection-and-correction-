> **An AI-Powered Adaptive Gamified Ecosystem for Developing Sinhala Language Skills in Primary Students.**

---

## 📖 Abstract

**Sinhala Mithuru** is a cutting-edge research initiative addressing the critical learning gaps in primary education for the low-resource Sinhala language. Moving beyond static digitization, this ecosystem leverages advanced **Deep Learning** and **Adaptive Algorithms** to offer a personalized pedagogy.

The system targets four core competencies: **Handwriting, Pronunciation, Reading Comprehension, and Grammar**. By integrating novel Hybrid Neural Architectures and Transfer Learning, the system acts as an intelligent tutor that diagnoses subtle errors and adapts content in real-time.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The project follows a scalable **Microservices Architecture**, containerized via Docker.

* **Frontend:** A cross-platform tablet application built with **Flutter & Flame Engine**.
* **Backend:** Independent AI inference services (APIs) built with **Python (Flask/FastAPI)**.
* **Orchestration:** Managed via **Docker Compose**.

## 🔬 Advanced Research Components

This project introduces significant novelties in applying AI to a morphologically rich, low-resource language.

### 1. ✍️ End-to-End Deep Learning System for Sinhala Handwriting (Component 1)
* **Research Problem:** Addressing the complexity of Sinhala script (60+ characters, 15+ modifiers) and the need for process-oriented feedback.
* **Methodology: Hybrid Deep Neural Framework**
    * **Model A (Visual):** A **Multi-Headed CNN** for static character and modifier prediction.
    * **Model B (Temporal):** An **LSTM/Transformer** network to analyze the writing process (stroke order and direction) as a time series.
* **Key Innovation:** Fusion of spatial and temporal analysis for holistic handwriting evaluation.

### 2. 🗣️ Siamese-Based Metric Learning for Pronunciation Verification (Component 2)

* **Research Problem:**
    Standard Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are optimized for word transcription, not phonetic verification. They often fail to distinguish between **Sinhala Minimal Pairs**—phonemes with subtle acoustic differences like **'බ' (Retroflex)** vs **'ඹ' (Dental)** . In low-resource settings like child speech, standard classifiers struggle to learn these nuances without massive datasets.

* **Methodology: Deep Metric Learning Framework**
    * **Architecture:** A **Siamese Neural Network** (Twin Network) architecture. It uses **Wav2Vec 2.0 Base** as the shared backbone feature extractor to generate context-aware acoustic embeddings.
    * **Objective Function:** The model is trained using **Triplet Margin Loss**.
        * *Formula:* $L(A, P, N) = \max(\|f(A)-f(P)\|^2 - \|f(A)-f(N)\|^2 + \alpha, 0)$
        * *Mechanism:* The network learns a distance metric where the embedding of a student's correct pronunciation (Positive) is pulled closer to a reference template (Anchor), while an incorrect pronunciation (Negative) is pushed apart by a defined margin ($\alpha$).
    * **Data Strategy:** Utilizes **Hard Negative Mining** during training. Instead of random negatives, the model is explicitly trained on confusing pairs (e.g., using 'බ' as the negative example for 'ඹ') to force it to learn distinct acoustic features.

* **Key Innovation:**
    * **Contrastive Phonetic Disambiguation:** Shifts the paradigm from "Classification" (predicting a label) to "Metric Learning" (measuring acoustic similarity), which is far more robust for error detection.
    * **Few-Shot/Zero-Shot Capability:** The system can verify new words/phonemes without retraining the core model, simply by updating the reference embeddings in the database.
